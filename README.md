# Integration Kit

**Integration Kit** is a developer-focused repository for creating and managing SIEM integrations.  
It provides a structured way to build and test:

- **Parsers & Connectors** → Normalize raw logs (Syslog, Windows Event Logs, cloud telemetry, etc.)
- **Detection Rules** → Write, share, and validate Sigma/Splunk/Elastic-style rules
- **Playbooks** → Document investigation & response steps for alerts
- **Dashboards** → Store and version-control SIEM dashboards (Kibana, Grafana, etc.)
- **CI/CD Pipelines** → Automatically lint, test, and validate contributions

This repo helps detection engineers, SOC analysts, and security developers **accelerate SIEM integration projects** by standardizing how we share and reuse content.
